<h1>R6Intel : What is this project?</h1>
R6Intel was one of my first programming project's designed to help people learn useful information such as maps, characters and sounds for the game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. It was presented to the user in a quiz-like format where they were presented with an image and they typed in the "callout" / location of where that image took place. If the user was correct they were awarded with a point, else, they could skip and be told where that location is so they can know it for next time.


<h1>How to test R6Intel?</h1>
R6Intel is not and probably won't be finished but the callout learning environment is working with some of the maps in Rainbow Six Siege. Try it here: https://josh417.github.io/R6Intel/callouts.html
